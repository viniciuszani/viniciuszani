# Hi There! üëã

Let me to share a bit about what I've been working on. 

Currently, I'm primarily focused on building projects with Typescript, which I believe is a fantastic language for building complex, scalable applications. One thing that's important to me is ensuring that my code is well-tested, which is why I take the time to write good quality unit tests for all of my code.

In my role as a developer, I have a versatile set of skills that allow me to contribute to all aspects of the development process. I'm just as comfortable defining project goals and key results (OKRs) and creating design documents as I am shipping code and maintaining production environments. I believe that having a broad understanding of the development process helps me to be a better contributor.

When it comes to development methodologies, I'm a currently using agile practices. I believe that communication and collaboration are key to building great and complex software.

While my primary focus is currently on Typescript, I have experience with a range of other programming languages as well. In the past, I've worked with Dart and Flutter, which I found to be a powerful combination for building cross-platform mobile apps. I've also worked with PHP, which is a language that I believe is under-appreciated in some circles but can be incredibly effective for building web applications.

Overall, I'm passionate about building great software. If you have any questions or would like to chat about a potential collaboration, feel free to reach out.

Thanks for stopping by! üçª
